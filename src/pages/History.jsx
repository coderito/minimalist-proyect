              I was born in Cauquenes, Maule region, Chile in 2002, since I was
              a child I was always interested in the world of computers, I
              remember I had a computer that looked like an old TV in which I
              could spend all afternoon on it without noticing, I remember I had
              a friend who was more adult than me, I always saw him programming
              and it caught my attention, but at that time I did not understand
              anything, nor understood what was the word "program".
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm max-w-xl text-justify mb-1 indent-3 lg:indent-5 text-stone-800 dark:text-stone-200">
              Time passed and I got a computer with an Intel Celeron, but it was
              my first computer, I remember that I was super anxious to receive
              it, I remember that I always watched videos on YouTube to add
              extra features to the computer and make it stand out from others.

            <p className="text-sm max-w-xl mb-1 text-justify    indent-3 lg:indent-5 text-stone-800 dark:text-stone-200">
              Then with the passage of time I entered the career programmer
              analyst in which I have no regrets because I could know the world
              of programming more thoroughly, I remember that arriving after
              high school I always saw more than any video on YouTube to not
              stay only with the subject that teachers passed, in that area I
              always felt confident in the evaluations that touched me because I
              always felt that I saw that subject on the internet. Once I had to
              do the "Advanced Programming" course, I thought it would be
              difficult, but I realized that in reality it was not as difficult
              as I thought and this allowed me to interact with people because I
              did not spend so much time studying, since I was doing quite well,
              this allowed me to have a quieter life and thanks to this I met a
              wonderful person who encourages me every day to keep improving
              myself and keep improving my programming skills.
